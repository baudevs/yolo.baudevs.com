# 🚀 The YOLO Methodology

Welcome to YOLO - You Only Live Once, a modern, developer-friendly project management methodology that combines the best of agile practices with the reality of how developers actually work. YOLO is designed to make project management fun, efficient, and naturally integrated into your development workflow.

## 🌟 Core Philosophy

YOLO is built on three fundamental principles:

1. **Joy in Development**: Work should be enjoyable and meaningful
2. **Natural Flow**: Tools should adapt to how developers work, not the other way around
3. **Visible Progress**: Everyone should see and understand project momentum

## 🎯 Key Concepts

### Project Structure

YOLO organizes work in a hierarchical yet flexible structure:

#### 1. Epics (Big Dreams) 🌈
- Large, ambitious goals that inspire the team
- Self-contained initiatives that deliver significant value
- Usually span multiple weeks or months
- Example: "Build an AI-powered Search System"

#### 2. Features (Building Blocks) 🏗️
- Concrete functionalities that support an epic
- Clear, measurable outcomes
- Typically completed in days or weeks
- Example: "Implement Real-time Search Suggestions"

#### 3. Tasks (Daily Work) ✨
- Specific, actionable items
- Clear definition of done
- Usually completed in hours or days
- Example: "Add Debouncing to Search Input"

### Work Management

#### Organic Progress Tracking 📈
- Work moves naturally through states: `planning` → `in-progress` → `done`
- No artificial time boxes or sprint constraints
- Progress is visible and celebrated

#### Relationship-Based Planning 🔗
- Work items are connected based on natural relationships
- Dependencies are explicit and visible
- Changes in one area show impacts on related items

#### Living Documentation 📚
- Documentation evolves with the code
- AI assists in maintaining up-to-date docs
- Knowledge is shared automatically

## 🛠️ The YOLO CLI Tool

Our CLI tool brings the YOLO methodology to life right in your terminal:

### Core Commands

# Get AI assistance
yolo ask "How should I structure this feature?"
```
