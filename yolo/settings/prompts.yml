# YOLO Methodology Prompts

# Documentation prompts
standard_documentation: |
  awesome! now document everything according to our yolo methodology in @yolo folder adding the epics, tasks and the relationships between all of them, update the @README @WISHES @STRATEGY and @HISTORY and @CHANGELOG  as we do in the YOLO methodology. Remember: we don't delete anything or lines, we just mark as deprecated, added, implemented, not relevant, anything that changes, so we can keep a complete history of the evolution of our project. @CHANGELOG.md and @README.md maintain standard development practices, like SemVer. Remember we never delete anything, we always add lines, mark as deprecated, implemented, not relevant, updated, improved, created, fixed, deleted, and keep adding context to the project.
