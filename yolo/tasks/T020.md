Epic: [E003] Epic for create relationships between tasks, features and epics creating files for each or linking if the exist

## Description
Task Description:

For the feature "create relationships between tasks, features and epics creating files for each or linking if they exist", we need you to develop an algorithm that will check whether a file already exists for a given task, feature, or epic. This algorithm will play a key part in our file linking mechanism and prevent the creation of duplicate files.

Detailed Requirements:

1. The algorithm should accept the name or ID of the task, feature or epic as an input.
2. Scan the designated file path or database where the existing relevant files are stored.
3. Check if there's a file that corresponds to the given task, feature, or epic in the designated location.
4. If a matching file is found, the algorithm should return 'True'.
5. If no matching file is found, the algorithm should return 'False'.

Success Criteria:
The algorithm will be considered successful if it can:

1. Accept the name or ID of a task, feature, or epic as input and process it accordingly.
2. Successfully scan the proper directory or database for the existing files.
3. Accurately identify whether a file related to input task, feature, or epic exists or not.
4. Consistently return accurate and reliable results: 'True' when a file exists and 'False' when it does not.

Note:
Please make sure that the algorithm is efficient enough to handle a large number of file checks as our platform scales, and for any additional requirements, please discuss with the project manager. Code should be well-commented, and documentation should be thorough and clear. 

Upon task completion, please peer review your code before moving the task to the "Done" status in our project management tool. You will then demonstrate your work during our next project meeting to showcase its functionality. Please also be prepared to discuss any challenges faced and how you resolved them.
