# Task T001: CLI Command for Project Creation

## Description

The task aims to implement a new command-line interface (CLI) command that enables users to create new projects by selecting from a range of predefined AI project templates. This command should be intuitive and guide the user through the process of selecting a project template, defining project-specific configuration (e.g., project name, directory), and initializing the project environment accordingly.

### Implementation Details

- The CLI command should be named `create-project`.
- Upon invocation, the command should list all available AI project templates fetched from a central template repository. This list must be dynamically generated to ensure it reflects the most current selection of templates.
- Users should be able to select a template either by navigating through an interactive menu or by specifying the template name directly as a command argument.
- Once a template is selected, the command should prompt the user for essential project details such as project name and destination directory. Sensible defaults should be provided for each prompt.
- After collecting all necessary inputs, the `create-project` command should proceed to scaffold the new project by copying the template files to the specified directory and performing any required initial setup tasks (e.g., initializing a git repository, installing dependencies).
- The command should provide clear, concise feedback throughout the process, including a success message upon completion with instructions on how to start working on the newly created project.

## Status

- **Current State:** Planned
- **Next Steps:** 
  1. Finalize the list of initial templates to be supported.
  2. Design the user interaction flow for the CLI command.
  3. Implement the command in the CLI tool.

## Parent Feature and Epic

- **Parent Feature:** [F003] AI Project Templates
- **Parent Epic:** [E002] Customizable Framework Templates

## Technical Requirements

1. **Programming Language:** The CLI tool should be implemented in Python to align with the existing toolchain.
2. **Template Management:** The tool must integrate with a central repository for template management, supporting CRUD operations for templates.
3. **User Interface:** Implement an intuitive and interactive CLI interface using libraries like Click or argparse for parsing command-line arguments and Inquirer.py for interactive prompts.
4. **Documentation:** All features and options of the `create-project` command should be thoroughly documented, including examples.

## Success Criteria

1. A user can list all available project templates using the CLI command.
2. A user can create a new project based on a chosen template with the ability to specify project details interactively.
3. The command executes successfully, scaffolding a new project in the specified directory, ready for development.
4. The command's functionality and ease of use are validated through user testing.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Research and Dependency Installation**: Research the required libraries and install necessary dependencies.
2. **Command Structure Design**: Define the command structure, including all options and flags.
3. **Interactive Menu Implementation**: Develop the interactive menu for template selection using Inquirer.py or a similar library.
4. **Template Processing**: Implement logic for fetching templates from the central repository and processing template files.
5. **Project Initialization**: Develop the functionality for initializing the new project, including directory setup, file copying, and running initialization scripts.
6. **Testing and Validation**: Write unit and integration tests for the new command to ensure reliability and perform user acceptance testing.
7. **Documentation**: Document the command usage, options, examples, and best practices in the project's official documentation.

By completing these steps, we will have added a valuable tool to our CLI, empowering users to kickstart their AI projects with ease.
