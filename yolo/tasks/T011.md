# P002: Platform Design

## Description

The aim of this task is to create an intuitive and user-friendly design for the community platform which will serve as a central hub for collaboration, discussion, and support among community members. The design should prioritize ease of navigation, accessibility, and engaging UI to encourage active participation.

**Specific Implementation Details:**

- Utilize a responsive design to ensure the platform is accessible on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
- Incorporate branding elements (e.g., logos, colors) provided by the marketing team to maintain visual consistency with other community assets.
- Design a simple yet effective navigation system that allows users to easily find and participate in discussions, access resources, and seek support.
- Create wireframes for key pages including the homepage, discussion forums, resource library, and support ticket submission page.
- Consider implementing a design system for scalability and maintainability of the platform's UI components.

## Technical Requirements

1. **Accessibility:** The design must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards to ensure the platform is accessible to individuals with disabilities.
2. **Front-End Frameworks:** Design should be implementable using modern front-end frameworks (e.g., React, Vue.js) to facilitate easy integration with the backend systems.
3. **Compatibility:** Ensure compatibility with major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) in their latest versions to maximize user reach.
4. **Scalability:** Design elements such as fonts, margins, and component spacing should utilize relative units for better scalability and responsiveness.

- Achieving a minimum score of 90 on the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 AA compliance test.
- Approval from the marketing team regarding brand consistency.
- Sign-off from the development team confirming the feasibility of implementing the design with the chosen technology stack.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Research & Analysis:**
   - Analyze existing community platforms for best practices and design inspirations.
   - Collect feedback from community members on their needs and preferences.
   
2. **Design Phase:**
   - Develop wireframes for key pages and navigation flows.
   - Create a design system including color schemes, typography, and UI components.
   - Conduct initial review sessions with the stakeholder groups to gather feedback.

3. **User Testing:**

   - Conduct user testing sessions to validate design assumptions and gather user feedback.

4. **Iteration:**
   - Refine designs based on feedback from user testing and stakeholder reviews.
   - Repeat user testing if significant changes are made to the initial designs.

5. **Handoff:**
   - Prepare and deliver final design specifications and assets to the development team.
   - Provide necessary documentation and guidelines for implementing the design system and components.
   
6. **Review & Approval:**
   - Conduct a final review with stakeholders to ensure the design meets all requirements and expectations.
