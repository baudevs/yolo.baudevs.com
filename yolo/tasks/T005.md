# T001: Template Development

## Description

The aim of this task is to create a comprehensive library of customizable project templates that will serve as an essential tool for speeding up the development process, ensuring consistency, and aiding new developers in getting started with projects. These templates should cater to a diverse set of project types within the realm of AI development, covering various common functionality, project setups, and best practices.

Implementation Details:

- The template library must be scalable, allowing for easy addition of new templates.
- Each template should come with a README file providing guidance on how to use it, its purpose, and customizing options.
- Templates should be designed with customization in mind, enabling users to tweak configurations, styles, and predefined code blocks according to their project needs.
- Incorporate AI-centric features and modules, considering the latest advancements and trends in AI technologies.
- Ensure compatibility with major development environments and tools used in AI projects.

## Status

- **Current State:** Planned
- **Next Steps:** Gathering requirements and defining template standards.

## Parent Feature and Epic References

- Parent Feature: [F003] AI Project Templates
- Parent Epic: [E002] Customizable Framework Templates

## Technical Requirements

1. **Language and Framework Compatibility:** Templates must be compatible with the most used programming languages and frameworks in AI development (e.g., Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch).
2. **Modularity:** Templates should be highly modular, allowing developers to integrate only the components they need into their projects.
3. **Versioning:** Implement a versioning system for templates to manage updates and iterations efficiently.
4. **Testing:** Include baseline tests for each template to ensure reliability and functionality.
5. **Documentation:** Each template must be fully documented, including setup instructions, customization guidance, and use case examples.

## Success Criteria

1. At least ten initial project templates developed and documented.
2. Positive feedback from the first round of user testing, indicating templates are easy to use and customize.
3. Demonstration of reduced setup time for new projects using the templates compared to traditional setup methodologies.
4. Templates should support the top three AI development frameworks and languages.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Requirement Gathering:** Work with AI developers and stakeholders to identify the most needed types of project templates.
2. **Design Phase:** Create design documents for each template, outlining its structure, core components, and customization options.
3. **Development:** Start the development of templates in order of priority determined during the requirement gathering phase.
    - Implement core features and functionalities.
    - Ensure modularity and customization capabilities.
    - Write initial documentation for each template.
4. **Testing:** Conduct thorough testing of each template to ensure functionality, compatibility, and ease of use.
    - Collect feedback from test users.
    - Make necessary adjustments based on feedback.
5. **Release:** Finalize documentation, package templates, and release them to the library.
    - Create a release note highlighting the features and potential use cases of each template.
6. **Maintenance and Updates:** Establish a process for the ongoing maintenance and updating of templates based on user feedback and advancements in AI technologies.
