# T001: Interactive Tutorial Interface

## Description

The goal of this task is to develop an interactive Command Line Interface (CLI) that allows users to easily navigate through the tutorials provided by our software. The interface should be user-friendly, intuitive, and guide users through the tutorials in a step-by-step manner. It should support various functionalities such as navigating forwards and backwards through the tutorial steps, viewing a list of available tutorials, and starting or resuming a tutorial from where the user left off.

### Specific Implementation Details:

- The interface should be implemented using a CLI framework that supports interactive prompts, such as `Inquirer.js` for Node.js applications.
- Each tutorial should be modular and defined in a separate file with a standardized format, facilitating easy addition or modification of tutorials.
- Progress tracking for each user should be implemented, allowing users to resume tutorials.
- Include support for rich text formatting within the CLI, such as bold text and colors, for better readability and user engagement.
- Provide help commands within the CLI for users to access information on how to use the interface and navigate through the tutorials.
