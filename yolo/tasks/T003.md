# [T001] Advanced AI Topics Tutorial

## Description

The aim of this tutorial is to cover advanced topics in Artificial Intelligence, with a particular focus on deep learning optimization, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and reinforcement learning. These areas represent the cutting edge of AI research and application, and are of great interest to professionals looking to deepen their knowledge and practical skills in AI.

### Deep Learning Optimization
- Introduction to optimization algorithms: SGD, Adam, RMSprop
- Techniques for avoiding overfitting: dropout, batch normalization
- Advanced topics: gradient clipping, learning rate schedules

### Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
- Understanding GANs: The basic architecture and its components
- Applications of GANs: Image generation, data augmentation, and beyond
- Building a simple GAN: Step-by-step guide

### Reinforcement Learning
- Key concepts: Agent, environment, policy, reward
- Model-based vs. model-free reinforcement learning
- Implementing a reinforcement learning solution with Q-learning

Each section should combine theoretical explanations with practical, hands-on coding exercises. The tutorial should also highlight current research trends and potential applications of each technology in various industries.
