# Progress Data Model [ID: PDM001]

## Description

The Progress Data Model (PDM) is designed to systematically track and store progress data across various entities in the Progress Tracking System. It aims to provide a structured and reliable way to measure and record the advancement or development of tasks, projects, or any form of activities that have a defined start and endpoint. The data model will encompass essential attributes such as the entity's identifier, start date, end date, current status, completion percentage, and any relevant metadata that supports the tracking process.

The model will be implemented with scalability in mind, ensuring it can handle various types of progress tracking, from simple task completions to complex project milestones. It will also support hierarchical tracking, accommodating parent-child relationships within tasks or projects, mirroring the structure of the broader Progress Tracking System.

### Specific Implementation Details:

- **Entity Identification:** Every tracked progress entity will have a unique identifier to ensure accurate tracking and retrieval.
- **Time Tracking:** Attributes for both the start and end dates, alongside a timestamp for the last update, will be included to monitor the timeline of progress accurately.
- **Status and Completion:** To reflect the current state of progress, status indicators (such as Not Started, In Progress, Complete) and a completion percentage will be included.
- **Metadata Storage:** A flexible schema for metadata will be incorporated to store additional information pertinent to the progress, such as tags or links to related documents.

## Parent Feature and Epic References

- **Parent Feature:** [F005] Progress Tracking System
- **Parent Epic:** [E004] Progress Tracking

## Technical Requirements

1. **Database Schema Design:** Create a normalized database schema that efficiently stores progress information while minimizing redundancy.
2. **API Interface:** Design an API layer that facilitates reading, creating, updating, and deleting progress data.
3. **Data Integrity Measures:** Implement constraints and checks within the database to ensure that the progress data remains accurate and consistent.
4. **Scalability Considerations:** The model must be designed to scale seamlessly with an increase in data volume and complexity.
5. **Security Measures:** Ensure that access to progress data is secured and compliant with data protection regulations.

## Success Criteria

1. **Accuracy:** The model accurately tracks and reflects the progress of entities without data discrepancies.
2. **Performance:** Queries related to progress tracking are executed efficiently, ensuring minimal latency in data retrieval.
3. **Scalability:** The system can handle a significant increase in tracked entities without degradation in performance.
4. **Usability:** The API layer provides clear and intuitive endpoints for managing progress data.
5. **Security:** Data access is tightly controlled, with audit trails for data access and changes.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Requirement Analysis:** Conduct a thorough analysis to gather all necessary requirements for the progress data model.
2. **Design Phase:** Create a detailed schema design that meets the technical requirements outlined above.
3. **API Development:** Develop the API layer based on the designed schema, ensuring it provides necessary functionalities like CRUD operations for progress data.
4. **Integration Testing:** Integrate the new data model with the Progress Tracking System for testing, ensuring compatibility and efficiency.
5. **Deployment:** Deploy the data model in a production environment, following best practices for database migration and deployment.
6. **Monitoring and Optimization:** Continuously monitor the system's performance post-deployment, optimizing as necessary to ensure it meets the success criteria.

By following these steps, the Progress Data Model will be successfully implemented, providing a robust foundation for tracking progress within the system.
