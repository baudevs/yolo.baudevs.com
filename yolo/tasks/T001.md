# [T001] Basic AI Concepts Tutorial

## Description

This tutorial aims to provide a foundational understanding of basic Artificial Intelligence (AI) concepts including machine learning, neural networks, and data preprocessing. The content should be designed for beginners with little to no prior knowledge of AI. The tutorial will be interactive, offering examples and exercises to engage the learner actively.

### Implementation Details

- **Machine Learning (ML):** Introduction to machine learning, types of machine learning (supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning), basic algorithms, and use cases.
- **Neural Networks (NNs):** Fundamentals of neural networks, how they work, an introduction to deep learning, and simple architectures.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Importance of data preprocessing in ML, techniques for data cleaning, transformation, normalization, and data splitting.

Each section should include:
- A brief theoretical explanation.
- Interactive examples where learners can tweak parameters or data and see results in real-time.
- Quizzes at the end of each section to assess understanding.

## Status

**Planned**

## Parent Feature and Epic References

4. Ensure accessibility standards are met to cater to all users, including those with disabilities.

## Success Criteria

1. Users should be able to explain basic AI concepts confidently, including machine learning, neural networks, and data preprocessing.
2. Users can complete the interactive examples and quizzes with at least an 80% success rate.
3. Positive feedback from users, with at least 75% expressing satisfaction with the tutorial content and structure.
4. High engagement rates, as measured by time spent on the tutorial and completion rates.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Content Development:**
   - Research and gather resources on basic AI concepts.
   - Draft the content, focusing on simplicity and clarity.
   - Develop interactive examples and quizzes.
   - Review and iterate based on feedback from subject matter experts.

2. **Platform Integration:**
   - Design the tutorial layout following the technical and accessibility requirements.
   - Implement interactive elements using chosen client-side technologies.
   - Embed quizzes and exercises within the tutorial content.
   - Test on various devices and browsers to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.

3. **Launch and Feedback Collection:**
   - Make the tutorial available to a limited audience for initial feedback.
   - Iterate based on user feedback and performance data.
   - Roll out the final version to all users.
   - Set up mechanisms for ongoing feedback collection and monitoring.
