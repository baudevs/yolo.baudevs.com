# [T101] Progress Tracking Integration

## Description

The task involves integrating a progress tracking mechanism into the existing Command Line Interface (CLI) to provide users with real-time feedback on the status of their operations. The integration should seamlessly blend with the current CLI architecture, ensuring minimal disruption to the existing user workflow. 

Specific implementation details include:

- **Real-time Feedback**: The CLI should output progress indicators for long-running tasks, such as file uploads or data processing operations.
- **Progress Indicators**: Implement both numeric (e.g., "45% complete") and graphical (e.g., progress bars) indicators based on the operation complexity and duration.
- **Error Handling**: In case of failure or interruption, the system should display meaningful error messages alongside suggestions for resolution or next steps.
- **Log Generation**: Automatically generate logs for each operation, including start time, end time, duration, and status (success or failure), for auditing purposes.

## Status

- [ ] Planned

## Parent Feature and Epic References

- Parent Feature: [F005] Progress Tracking System
- Parent Epic: [E004] Progress Tracking

## Technical Requirements

1. Ensure compatibility with the current CLI's programming language and design architecture.
2. Use lightweight libraries or frameworks to avoid unnecessary bloat.
3. Design for extensibility to support future enhancements like detailed sub-task tracking or integration with external progress tracking tools.
4. Implement unit tests and integration tests to cover new functionalities.
5. Utilize ANSI escape codes for styling progress indicators in terminals that support it, with a fallback to simpler indicators in non-compatible terminals.

## Success Criteria

1. Progress indicators are accurately displayed for at least 90% of long-running tasks.
2. Performance impact is negligible, with task execution times not increasing by more than 5% due to the overhead of progress tracking.
3. User feedback is positive regarding the clarity and utility of the progress indicators.
4. Error messages and logs are informative and useful for debugging and auditing purposes.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Requirement Gathering**: Collaborate with the UI/UX team to define exact requirements for progress indication and error messaging.
2. **Design Phase**: Architect the enhancements, focusing on integration points within the existing CLI framework. Design should include fallback mechanisms for terminals not supporting complex indicators.
3. **Development**:
   - Implement the progress tracking logic as a separate module, ensuring it does not adversely affect the CLI's performance.
   - Develop the user interface for displaying progress and error messages, adhering to the designs agreed upon in the design phase.
4. **Testing**:
   - Conduct unit and integration testing to ensure the new features work as expected across supported platforms and terminals.
   - Gather initial user feedback in a controlled beta test.
5. **Deployment**: Roll out the feature in the next CLI update. Ensure documentation is updated to reflect the new capabilities.
6. **Monitoring and Feedback Loop**: Monitor usage and performance, gathering user feedback for future refinements.
