# Task: Search Interface Development

## Description

The goal of this task is to develop a Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool for searching the database. This interface should enable users to efficiently query the database for troubleshooting and problem-solving purposes. The CLI should be intuitive and support a range of search queries to cater to different troubleshooting needs.

### Specific Implementation Details:
- **Search Capability:** The CLI must support basic search queries, including exact match and wildcard searches.
- **Performance:** Search responses should be fast, aiming for sub-second response times for typical queries.
- **User Feedback:** Provide clear, understandable feedback for unsuccessful searches (e.g., no results found, invalid query format).
- **Logging:** All searches should be logged with timestamps for future audits or improvements.

## Status

- **Current State:** Planned

## Parent Feature and Epic References

- **Parent Feature:** [F004] Troubleshooting Database
- **Parent Epic:** [E003] On-the-go Problem Solving

## Technical Requirements

1. **Programming Language:** The CLI tool should be developed in Python or Go for ease of deployment and compatibility.
2. **Database Integration:** Must integrate seamlessly with SQL and NoSQL databases, ensuring broad compatibility.
3. **Security:** Implement basic security measures, including input validation to prevent SQL injection or other common vulnerabilities.
4. **Portability:** The tool should be platform-independent, capable of running on Linux, Windows, and macOS.
5. **Documentation:** Comprehensive user documentation should be provided, detailing installation, usage, and examples of search queries.

## Success Criteria

1. **Accuracy:** The search tool returns accurate results for a variety of test queries.
2. **Performance:** All search queries return results in under one second under normal load conditions.
3. **Usability:** User feedback indicates that the CLI is intuitive and easy to use with a shallow learning curve.
4. **Security:** The tool passes a basic security audit without any critical issues.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Requirements Gathering:** Confer with stakeholders to refine the search functionality and expected outcomes.
2. **Environment Setup:** Prepare development environments with the necessary tools and database access for testing.
3. **Prototype Development:** Develop a basic prototype supporting simple search queries to validate the concept.
4. **Feedback Loop:** Present the prototype to a focus group for initial feedback and iterate on the design.
5. **Feature Implementation:** Expand the prototype into a fully-featured CLI, incrementally adding the planned functionalities and integrating security measures.
6. **Testing and Iteration:** Conduct thorough testing, including unit tests, integration tests, and performance benchmarks. Iterate based on test results.
7. **Documentation:** Write comprehensive documentation for the tool, including setup, usage guides, and examples.
8. **Release:** Deploy the CLI for internal use and gather feedback for future improvements.
