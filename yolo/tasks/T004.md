# [C001] Interactive Coding Challenges

## Description

The objective of this task is to implement interactive coding challenges within the tutorials to reinforce the learning process. These challenges will be integrated into the existing tutorial content, allowing users to apply the concepts they've learned in a practical, hands-on manner. Each challenge will be specifically tailored to the tutorial topic, ensuring relevance and effectiveness in reinforcing the material.

**Implementation Details:**

- Challenges will present users with a problem statement related to the tutorial topic.
- Users will enter their code solution into an embedded code editor within the tutorial page.
- A backend service will compile and run the submitted code, checking for correctness against predefined test cases.
- Feedback will be provided to the user through the same interface, including whether the solution was correct, and hints for incorrect solutions.
- Progress tracking will be enabled, allowing users to see which challenges they have completed.

- **Parent Epic:** [E001] Interactive Tutorials

## Technical Requirements

1. **Integrated Code Editor:** A web-based code editor must be embedded into tutorial pages, supporting syntax highlighting for languages covered in the tutorials.
2. **Backend Compilation and Execution Service:** A service is required to securely compile and execute user-submitted code, returning results to the user.
3. **Challenge Database:** A database or storage solution for managing challenge definitions, including problem statements, solution templates, test cases, and hints.
4. **User Progress Tracking:** The system must track user progress throughout the challenges, including completed and pending challenges.
5. **Security:** Implement security measures to prevent code injection attacks and to safely execute user-submitted code.

## Success Criteria

1. **User Engagement:** Increase in tutorial completion rates by at least 20% after the introduction of coding challenges.
2. **Accuracy:** 95% success rate in correctly evaluating user-submitted solutions.
3. **Usability:** User feedback scores averaging 4.5/5 or higher regarding the interface and overall challenge experience.
4. **Performance:** Code execution and feedback provided within 3 seconds for 90% of submissions.
5. **Security:** No security breaches or vulnerabilities reported within the first 6 months of going live.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Design Challenge Interface:** Design the UI/UX for the coding challenges, including the embedded code editor and feedback mechanisms.
2. **Select Code Editor:** Research and select a web-based code editor library that meets our technical requirements.
3. **Develop Challenge Database:** Structure and develop the database for storing challenges, including schemas for problems, test cases, and hints.
4. **Implement Backend Service:** Develop the backend service for compiling and running user code. This includes setting up secure execution environments and integrating with the challenge database.
5. **Integrate with Tutorials:** Embed the coding challenge modules into the tutorial pages, ensuring they match the learning objectives of each tutorial.
6. **Testing:** Perform thorough testing, including unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance testing to ensure functionality and security.
7. **User Feedback Loop:** After initial release, gather user feedback and implement necessary adjustments to the challenge content, interface, or execution.
