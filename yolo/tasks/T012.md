# Task: T012 - Collaboration Features Implementation

## Description

The aim of this task is to enhance the community engagement on our platform by implementing collaboration features. These features will include forums for discussions and a system for sharing projects among users. This implementation will allow users to communicate, collaborate, and share feedback on different projects, fostering a rich community environment.

### Implementation Details:

- **Forums**: Should support creating threads, posting replies, and upvoting/downvoting posts. Moderation features for admins should also be included to manage the content.
- **Project Sharing**: Users should be able to share their projects with the community. This includes mechanisms for uploading project details, viewing shared projects, and filtering/searching through the projects.

## Status

**Planned**

This task is currently in the planning phase and awaits final approval and prioritization.
