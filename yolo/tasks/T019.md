Epic: [E003] Epic for create relationships between tasks, features and epics creating files for each or linking if the exist

## Description
Task Description: 

Your task is to design a system architecture that precisely defines and outlines the relationships between tasks, features, and epics in a clear, logically flowing manner. This process should support our main task of creating a comprehensive understanding of complex project scopes, functional dependencies, and interconnectedness between project elements.

Responsibilities:
1. Establish a practical, efficient, and scalable framework that manages and displays reciprocal interconnections between tasks, features, and epics.
2. Design the architecture by creating individual files for each task, feature, and epic. These should include their properties, behaviors, relationships, dependencies, descriptions, etc.
3. Ensure that the system architecture allows for linking between these files if and when they already exist to prevent redundancy or confusion.
4. Document the architecture design and process in a manner thatâ€™s understandable and accessible for all stakeholder groups, including developers, project managers, and other non-technical stakeholders.
5. Demonstrate how the architecture supports task tracking, resource allocation, and timeline management.
6. Validate the architecture by showing its functionality and ease of use in managing and determining the relationships between tasks, features, and epics.

Success Criteria:
1. The system architecture is designed in a clear, logical, and user-friendly format.
2. The architecture effectively defines and outlines the relationships between tasks, features, and epics, highlighting dependencies and interconnectedness.
3. The system allows for separate files to be created for each task, feature, and epic, and includes the option for linking previously existing files.
4. Documented design and process is easy to comprehend for all stakeholders and meets the required standards.
5. The architecture proves to be beneficial in managing and tracking project tasks, thus contributing to improved productivity and efficiency.
6. Upon review and testing, the architecture is found to be practical, functional, and user-friendly, gaining approval from all stakeholders.
