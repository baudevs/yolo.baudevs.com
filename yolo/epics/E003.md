## Description
Epic Description:

â€œImplement a comprehensive task management system that allows for the dynamic creation, linking, and management of tasks, features, and epics documented in uniquely identifiable files. This system should streamline workflow by promoting systemic relationships between these elements, fostering operational efficiency and interconnectivity. Whether the task is new or existing, the system should be able to intelligently link it to corresponding features or epics or create new document files as needed. This activity aims to improve transparency, communication and collaboration through an effective project lifecycle process, setting a strategic context for ongoing and future development projects. Potential expansion of this epic includes integration with existing project management tools, leveraging AI for predictive task creation and powerful search features to locate and navigate to different elements and their associated documents within the system."
