# Interactive Tutorials [Epic ID: IT001]

## Description

The goal of the "Interactive Tutorials" epic is to develop and deploy a comprehensive suite of interactive tutorials aimed at AI developers ranging from beginners to advanced. These tutorials will cover a wide array of topics related to Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and associated technologies and methodologies. The tutorials will be designed to provide hands-on, interactive learning experiences that allow developers to apply what they learn in real-time, within a guided environment.

The content will be structured to progressively increase in complexity, allowing developers to start with basic concepts and gradually advance to more complex topics. Each tutorial will incorporate interactive coding exercises, quizzes, and projects that enable users to apply concepts and receive immediate feedback. This approach will not only help in reinforcing theoretical knowledge but also in gaining practical experience.

## Status

- **Current State:** Planned
- **Planned Start Date:** TBD
- **Expected Completion Date:** TBD

## Dependencies

- **Content Development Tools:** Selection of appropriate tools and platforms for content creation and hosting.
- **SMEs (Subject Matter Experts):** Collaboration with experts in AI, ML, and DL to ensure the accuracy and relevance of the tutorial contents.
- **Technology Stack:** Decisions regarding the backend and frontend technologies to be used for the interactive components.
- **Legal & Compliance:** Review of legal and compliance aspects related to content creation and sharing, especially code examples and data sets used within tutorials.

## List of Features

1. **Interactive Code Editor:** A web-based code editor that allows users to edit and run code examples within the tutorial interface itself.
2. **Progress Tracking:** Users can track their progress through different modules, allowing for a personalized learning experience.
3. **Quizzes & Assessments:** Integrated quizzes and assessments to test knowledge retention and understanding of the tutorial content.
4. **Hands-On Projects:** Real-world projects that allow users to apply what they have learned in a practical scenario.
5. **Community Forum:** A dedicated forum for learners to discuss topics, share doubts, and collaborate on projects.
6. **Feedback System:** An in-built feedback mechanism for users to report errors, suggest improvements, and rate tutorials.

## Technical Considerations

- **Scalability:** The platform should be capable of handling a large number of concurrent users without degradation in performance.
- **Interoperability:** Code examples and projects should be compatible with multiple operating systems and devices.
- **Accessibility:** Tutorials should be accessible, following best practices to accommodate users with disabilities.
- **Localization:** Consideration for future localization of tutorials to support non-English speaking users.

## Success Criteria

1. **User Engagement:** High level of user engagement as indicated by time spent on tutorials, completion rates, and interactive elements use.
2. **Learning Outcomes:** Positive feedback from users regarding their learning experience and improvement in AI knowledge and skills.
3. **Technical Performance:** Smooth performance of the interactive components, with low error rates and high availability.
4. **Community Growth:** Active participation in the community forum, with users contributing to discussions, sharing insights, and collaborating on projects.
5. **Feedback and Iteration:** Positive reception of the feedback system, with constructive feedback leading to continuous improvement of the tutorials.
