# Feature F001: AI Project Templates

## Description

The AI Project Templates feature aims to provide a collection of pre-built project templates for common AI applications, such as image recognition and natural language processing (NLP). These templates will simplify the development process for developers by offering a structured starting point that includes essential libraries, sample code, and documentation.

### Implementation Details

The implementation of the AI Project Templates will involve the following components:

- **Template Library**: A repository of template projects that can be accessed and downloaded by users.
- **Documentation**: Detailed guides and references for each template, explaining the architecture, libraries used, and customization points.
- **Sample Data**: Where applicable, sample datasets will be provided to test and train the models.
- **Community Contributions**: A framework for the community to contribute additional templates or improvements to existing ones.

## Status

**Current State**: Planned

The AI Project Templates are currently in the planning stage. The project team is in the process of defining requirements, identifying key AI applications for initial templates, and setting up a template repository infrastructure.

## Parent Epic

- [E002] Customizable Framework Templates

This feature is a part of the larger initiative [E002] Customizable Framework Templates, which aims to provide a variety of framework and project templates for different programming needs and domains.

## List of Tasks

1. **Task T001**: Identify key AI applications for initial set of templates.
2. **Task T002**: Set up a repository for hosting AI project templates.
3. **Task T003**: Develop the first batch of AI project templates, including image recognition and NLP.
4. **Task T004**: Create detailed documentation for each template.
5. **Task T005**: Implement a contribution process for community-made templates.
6. **Task T006**: Launch a beta version of the template library for user feedback.

## Technical Requirements

- **Programming Languages**: Python, considering its popularity and extensive support in AI and machine learning communities.
- **Frameworks and Libraries**: TensorFlow or PyTorch for deep learning tasks; spaCy, NLTK for NLP-related templates.
- **Data Storage**: Cloud storage solutions for hosting samples and datasets.
- **Version Control**: Git for template versioning and community contributions management.
- **Continuous Integration/Deployment (CI/CD)**: For automated testing and deployment of template updates.

## Success Criteria

1. **Template Coverage**: Launch with at least five diverse AI project templates covering different AI applications.
2. **Documentation Quality**: Comprehensive, easy-to-understand documentation for each template, including setup, usage, and customization.
3. **Community Engagement**: Active participation from the community in terms of feedback, usage, and contributions to template improvements or new templates.
4. **User Satisfaction**: High satisfaction rates from user surveys on the usability and utility of the project templates.
5. **Adoption Rate**: A significant adoption rate measured by the number of downloads and active users of the templates within six months of launch.
