# Feature: CP-101 Community Platform

## Description

The **Community Platform** is designed to foster collaboration and support within our community. This integrated platform will serve as the central hub for community members to connect, share knowledge, and access support resources. Implementation of this feature involves creating an intuitive, user-friendly interface that enables seamless interaction among users. Key components include a forum for discussions, a resource library for knowledge sharing, and a support ticketing system for issues resolution.

### Implementation Details

- **Forum**: A discussion board for community members to ask questions, share insights, and connect on various topics. It will include features such as categories, tags, and a voting system for prioritizing content.
  
- **Resource Library**: A curated collection of articles, guides, and tutorials to help users learn and make the most of the community and its offerings. This library will facilitate easy searching and categorization.
  
- **Support Ticketing System**: An integrated system for users to report issues, request help, and track the status of their inquiries. This will include an admin interface for managing and responding to tickets.
