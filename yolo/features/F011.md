Epic: [E003] Epic for create relationships between tasks, features and epics creating files for each or linking if the exist

## Description
Feature Description:

1. Specific Functionality to be Implemented:
The key functionality of this feature revolves around enabling relationships between tasks, features, and epics. Users should have the capacity to create new tasks, projects or epics, which each get their unique identifier and corresponding document file within the system. The tasks can then be linked to corresponding features or existing epics. In cases where a suitable feature or epic doesn't exist, the system will create a new one intelligently. Apart from creation and linking, the feature should also facilitate management of these elements with provisions for updates, tracking, and deletion. The system should have powerful search features to locate and navigate different elements. The feature should also accommodate integration with existing project management tools and AI extrapolation for predictive task creation.


2. User Value and Benefits:
This feature enhances operational efficiency by streamlining workflow processes. Users can navigate the project elements fluidly due to the structural clarity this feature provides. It drastically reduces inefficiencies and redundancies caused by tasks, features, or epics that exist in isolation. It fosters improved transparency, communication, and collaboration, allowing team members to grasp the broader context of their tasks and how they fit into the overall project, thus enhancing individual and collective productivity.


3. Technical Considerations:
This feature requires robust back-end architecture to manage the creation, linking, and ordering of a high volume of tasks, features, and epics. The search functionality needs efficient data indexing and retrieval processes. Integration with existing project management tools will necessitate robust APIs and compatibility checks. AI-analyses for predictive task creation need to be engineered with precise algorithms and machine learning models that can learn from previous tasks and suggest new ones intelligently.


4. Success Criteria:
The success of this feature could be measured by:
- Reduced time to create, link, and manage tasks, features, and epics.
- Improvement in the clarity of project workflows, evidenced by a decrease in queries or confusions regarding task specifics or sequencing.
- A positive shift in team productivity and operational efficiency.
- Greater utilization of the feature by project teams, suggesting acceptance and utility.
- Seamless integration with existing project management tools with no data discrepancies or workflow disruptions.
- The accuracy of AI prediction for task creation and suggestions.
