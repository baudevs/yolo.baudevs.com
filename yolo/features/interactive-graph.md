   - Space for reset view

### Implementation Details
```javascript
// Node materials with states
nodeMaterials = {
    epic: {
        default: new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x3b82f6 }),
        hover: new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x60a5fa }),
        selected: new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x93c5fd })
    },
    // ... similar for feature and task
}

// Link materials with states
linkMaterials = {
    default: new THREE.LineBasicMaterial({
        color: 0x666666,
        opacity: 0.3
    }),
    highlighted: new THREE.LineBasicMaterial({
        color: 0x9ca3af,
        opacity: 0.6
    })
}
```
