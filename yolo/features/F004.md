# F102: Troubleshooting Database

## Description

The Troubleshooting Database is designed to be an expansive, easily accessible resource for developers working on AI projects. It intends to catalog a wide array of common issues encountered during AI development along with their resolutions. The database will be searchable, offering users the ability to quickly find solutions to specific problems or browse through categories of interest.

### Implementation Details

- **Database Structure**: The core of this feature is a relational database that stores problems and their solutions in a structured format. Each entry will include tags related to AI subfields (e.g., machine learning, natural language processing) for improved searchability.
- **Search Functionality**: Incorporating advanced search algorithms, including full-text search and filter-based search, to help users pinpoint information efficiently.
- **User Interface**: A clean, intuitive web interface that connects to the backend database, allowing users to search, view, and even contribute to the database after a review process.
- **Contribution Process**: A system for users to submit their own problems and solutions, subject to verification and approval by a panel of experts, to continually grow the databaseâ€™s knowledge base.

## Status

- **Current State**: Planned
- **Next Steps**: Finalizing the project plan and beginning the initial phase of development.

## List of Tasks

1. Define database schema, including tables for problems, solutions, and tags.
2. Develop a detailed project plan, outlining all stages of the database and UI development.
3. Implement the backend database using a suitable RDBMS (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).
4. Design and implement the search functionality with support for various filtering options.
5. Create the initial web interface design, focusing on user experience and accessibility.
6. Develop the contribution and review system to allow for community input.
7. Conduct thorough testing of the database and web interface to ensure reliability and usability.
8. Plan and execute a beta release to gather feedback and make necessary adjustments.

## Technical Requirements

- Use of a reliable and scalable relational database management system (RDBMS).
- Implementation of a robust search engine to handle complex queries.
- Frontend development using modern technologies (e.g., React, Angular) for a responsive design.
- Backend development preferably in a language known for stability and performance (e.g., Python, Node.js).
- Secure user authentication system for the contribution process.
- Compliance with data privacy laws and regulations to protect user information.

## Success Criteria

- **Functionality**: The database accurately stores and retrieves information with a low error rate.
- **Usability**: Users report high satisfaction with the interface and ease of finding solutions.
- **Adoption Rate**: A significant portion of the target user base begins using the database regularly within the first six months of launch.
- **Contribution Volume**: The database receives a steady stream of quality contributions from the community.
- **Performance Metrics**: Fast response times and high availability, with 99.9% uptime.
- **Security**: No major security incidents occur, and all user data is handled according to the highest standards of privacy.
