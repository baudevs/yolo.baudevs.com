# Feature F001: Progress Tracking System

## Description

The Progress Tracking System aims to implement an efficient and user-friendly way to track learning progression and project milestone achievements for users. The tracking system will visualize progression through easy-to-understand metrics and detailed reports, thus enabling users to monitor their achievements and setbacks in real-time. Implementation will involve the integration of a dynamic tracking interface within the existing platform, support for customizable milestone creation, and the deployment of analytics tools to generate insightful progression data.

Key implementation details include:
- Development of a user interface for progress visualization.
- Integration of a backend system to handle data regarding user learning paths and project milestones.
- Support for customizable milestone markers, allowing users to set and edit their own milestones based on personal or project objectives.
- Utilization of analytics tools to provide users with detailed reports on their progression, including time spent, milestones achieved, and areas needing improvement.
